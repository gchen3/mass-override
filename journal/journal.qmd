- Note that figures and tables (such as @fig-first and @tbl-one) should appear in the paper, not at the end or in separate files.
- In document front matter, you may set the key `blinded` under a `journal` key to hide the authors and acknowledgements, producing the required anonymized version.
- Remember that in the anonymized version, you should not identify authors indirectly in the text.  That is, don't say "In Smith et. al.  (2009) we showed that ...". Instead, say "Smith et. al. (2009) showed that ...".
- These points are only intended to remind you of some requirements.

proofs), identify them in the section below.  In early stages of the
submission process, you may be unsure what to include as supplementary
material.  Don't worry---this is something that can be worked out at later stages.
